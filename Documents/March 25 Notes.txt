315 TA Notes 3/25

Present in lab on Thursday 3/27
Functional Prototype due Friday 3/28


Just need to have something to implement simple gameplay
not full game; just basic mechanics


THREE MAIN TASKS TO ADDRESS:
1 - serverside: need to implement basic game mechanics here. 
    Handle messages (regarding movement etc.)
2 - interface: elements to support basic gameplay
3 - Communication between interface and the server

someone should focus on server side
someone should focus on interface side
decide which messages will be sent between the interface and the server. 
interface doesnt need to be done to test sending message to server


***make sure hosting service allows web sockets***
-> otherwise use cse servers
